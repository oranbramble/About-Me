# **About Me**

My name is Oran Bramble, a third year Computer Science BSc student currently studying at the Unviersity of Southampton. I've had mny trials and tribulations on this course but am nearing the end of it, and it has greatly improved my technical ability to code as well as my professional capabilities when working in a team. See below for a few things I have worked on and am currently working on.

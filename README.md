My name is Oran Bramble, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton. Having been studying Computer Science ever since I was 13, I have a vast knowledge base and have completed many projects. Most however, were pretty rookie and have been ommited here for my own dignity. For a few of my more successful ones plus current undertakings, see the repositories below:
